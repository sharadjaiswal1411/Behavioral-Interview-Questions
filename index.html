<h2>1. Tell me about yourself.</h2>
<p>As cliché as it may get but this question never fails to take the center stage in an interview. To ace your interview, it is imperative that you answer this question with ease and not brag about yourself. Do not recite your whole life story and sound robotic. Instead, follow the recipe of present-past-future. When the recruiter asks you to tell about yourself, start with your present designation. Then, dig into your past and tell him about your past experiences. Gradually, move to your future dreams and tell him why you’re excited about this job position. While you’re telling the recruiter about yourself, be careful to connect your 
skills and expertise with his requirements of the job position. This way you can convey a lot without being boring or dull.</p>
<h2>2. From where did you get to know about this job position?</h2>
<p>This is a simple yet a very tricky question that can take you a step closer or distance you form your dream job. You can answer this question in multiple ways. For example- if you’re up for the interview through your friend’s reference, tell the interviewer how you found about this job through your friend. Avoid being intricate and answer in a very simple tone. Another alternative to this question could be telling the interviewer the source of information about the job opening. 
  Do not get over-enthusiastic as this could be a total turn-off. Be short and crisp and add your personal spin.</p>
